\title{Convert Australian state names and abbreviations into a consistent format}
\usage{
strayr(string, to = "state_abbr", fuzzy_match = TRUE, max_dist = 0.4,
  method = "jw")
}
\arguments{
\item{string}{a character vector containing Australian state names or abbreviations}

\item{to}{what form should the state names be converted to? Options are
"state_name", "state_abbr" (the default), "iso", and "postal".}

\item{fuzzy_match}{logical; either TRUE (the default) which indicates that
approximate/fuzzy string matching should be used, or FALSE which indicates that
only exact matches should be used.}

\item{max_dist}{numeric, sets the maximum acceptable distance between your
string and the matched string. Default is 0.4. Only relevant when fuzzy_match is TRUE.}

\item{method}{the method used for approximate/fuzzy string matching. Default
is "jw", the Jaro-Winker distance; see `??stringdist-metrics` for more options.}

\examples{

x <- c("western Straya", "w. A ", "new soth wailes", "SA", "tazz")

# Convert the above to state abbreviations
strayr(x)

# Convert the elements of `x` to state names

strayr(x, to = "state_name")

# Disable fuzzy matching; you'll get NAs unless exact matches can be found

strayr(x, fuzzy_match = FALSE)

# You can use strayr in a dplyr mutate call

x_df <- data.frame(state = x, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

\dontrun{x_df \%>\% mutate(state_abbr = strayr(state))}
